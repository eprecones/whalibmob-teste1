# Frida attestation middleware

This folder holds the on-device [Frida](https://frida.re) scripts whalibmob
uses to obtain the hardware attestation tokens WhatsApp's registration server
expects from a genuine mobile client (Android Play Integrity / Keystore
attestation and iOS App Attest).


> folder. They are reference material — kept here so whalibmob users who own a
> rooted Android phone or a jailbroken iPhone can study the integration. They
> are **not** required for the ordinary request path: without them, unavailable
> attestation fields are omitted. Whether an unattested or partially attested
> registration is accepted remains server policy.

## How whalibmob uses it

`lib/Attestation.js` is an HTTP client for the local server these scripts
start on the phone. When `WA_FRIDA_HOST` (and optionally `WA_FRIDA_PORT`) is
set in the environment, whalibmob's registration flow (`lib/Registration.js`)
calls the endpoints below and folds their output into the `/code`,
`/register` and `/exist` request bodies — exactly the way Cobalt does:

| Platform | Endpoint      | Feeds registration field(s)                        |
|----------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Android  | `/info`       | apk hashes / signature / secret key (device info)  |
| Android  | `/integrity`  | `gpia` (+ `_gg _gi _gp _ge _ga`) Play Integrity     |
| Android  | `/cert`       | `&H=` body signature + `Authorization` cert chain  |
| iOS      | `/integrity`  | `&H=` App Attest assertion + `Authorization` header |

The default port matches the native app's WhatsApp consumer build: `1119`
(WhatsApp) / `1120` (WhatsApp Business).

When `WA_FRIDA_HOST` is unset, `lib/Attestation.js` returns empty tokens and
whalibmob emits the same fields with empty values — no device required.

## Requirements & run instructions

See `android/README.md` and `ios/README.md` for the per-platform setup
(rooted/jailbroken device, Frida server, building `server_with_dependencies.js`
with `frida-compile`, and attaching to the WhatsApp process).
